# Advanced Numerical Techniques (Lab) - M.Sc. Physics University of Delhi

## Semester: IV Course Code: PH-EL562

### Course Instructor : Professor Kirti Ranjan [>Profile<](https://du.irins.org/profile/60682)

As per our university syllabus, "This Lab course is designed to develop computer programming skills (primarily C/C++ based) for implementing advanced numerical methods like Interpolation, Solution of Linear Equations, Monte Carlo Methods, Curve-Fitting techniques etc. Throughout the semester work on a project oriented problem based on developing algorithm for any generalized numerical method which may be related with any of the topics covered in theory classes."

We have been advised to follow the book **[Numerical Analysis Richard L Burden and J Douglas Faires](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NZusaD5_vE2Yu1isd4G9M8Fesh6uCxBW/view?usp=sharing)** and to practice the problems we are getting assignments every week and here I'll commit the programs once I successfully compile and get the desired output after the submission deadline ofcourse.<br>
***This repository is under progress.***

## Do you want to download all the codes at once?
### For Linux user:
All the linux distributers have git installed in their system so they simply paste the following code in their terminal to get a local copy in your system.  
`git clone https://github.com/singhnir/DU-MSc-Phy-ANT-Lab.git`
### For Windows user:
Normally no windows has git preinstalled so previous command doesn't work on it but again you can download a zip copy of the codes clicking [**here**](https://github.com/singhnir/DU-MSc-Phy-ANT-Lab/archive/main.zip).

## Requirements
* Text Editor (Atom/Sublime...)
* GCC Compiler
* Gnuplot
